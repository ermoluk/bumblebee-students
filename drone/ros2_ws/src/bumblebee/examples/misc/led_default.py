"""
led_default.py -- Default LED pattern for Bumblebee drone.

Runs continuously as a systemd service:
  - LED_1, LED_3 (side strips)  : flowing rainbow stream across 4 pixels
  - LED_2, LED_6 (front)        : solid green

Each of the 4 pixels on a strip holds a different hue (90 deg apart).
Every frame the base hue advances, making colours flow like a stream.

Yields to other LED scripts via lock file /tmp/led_busy:
  - When /tmp/led_busy exists   : pauses and waits
  - When /tmp/led_busy removed  : resumes immediately

Start/stop is managed by led-default.service.
Do not run directly unless testing.
